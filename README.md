The goal of this Capstone project is to explore the Julia space, and see if a success story can be created when using Julia to implement a CV parsing pipeline. The ideal pipeline would consist of the following steps: 
1. Parsing of Job descriptions, extraction of company name, address, dates, requirements and compensation for a candidate. 
2. Parsing of CV. Extraction of name, age/birthday, location, education as a sequence of institution name/dates/specialization, experience as a sequence of company name/dates/job title/skills, separate skills
3. Connecting the parsed data with existing databases such as O*net.

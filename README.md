The goal of this Capstone project is to explore the Julia space, and see if a success story can be created when using Julia to implement a CV parsing pipeline. The ideal tasks to accomplish are as follows: 
1. Parsing of Job descriptions, extraction of company name, address, dates, requirements and compensation for a candidate. 
2. Parsing of CV. Extraction of name, age/birthday, location, education as a sequence of institution name/dates/specialization, experience as a sequence of company name/dates/job title/skills, separate skills
3. Connecting the parsed data with existing databases such as O*net.

To accomplish these goals, an intermediate goal is to have an out of the box model working within 1 week. That is, by Tuesday, March 31st. The steps to do so are currently listed as issues. Even if it appears your step relies on a previous step before you can complete it, you can still create dummy data and do your step without waiting on anyone. 

Also, remember to use good github practices.<br>
Don't commit directly to master<br> 
Pull from master<br> 
Checkout a branch<br> 
Make your changes<br> 
Pull from master before pushing to your remote branch<br> 
<br> 
Add a pull request when you feel your branch is ready and others in the group will review and merge.
